The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue with unexpected behavior when using the `calc()` function in conjunction with percentages.  The intended behavior is to set the width of an element to 50% of its parent's width, minus 10 pixels. However, the browser interprets the calculation incorrectly, potentially leading to unexpected layout issues:

```css
div {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

This issue is not always apparent and can depend on the browser and the context in which this code is used.  It's an uncommon bug because it hinges on a specific combination of CSS features and requires careful attention to detail.
